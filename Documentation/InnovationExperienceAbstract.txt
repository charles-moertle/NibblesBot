A common problem in robotics is locating objects and arranging them in some manner.
 In most cases, this is accomplished using an overhead camera that provides a “God’s eye”
 view, i.e., a view of an entire area. In this project, we are attempting a variation of
 this problem by removing the overhead camera and relying solely on a camera attached to
 the mobile robot that only provides a partial view of the area. In order to test our
 approach, our team’s goal is to use a TurtleBot3 Burger robot to rearrange several
 blocks into a specified order. To accomplish this task, we will assemble the mobile
 robot and modify it to suit the problem. The overall approach has the robot searching
 a designated area for blocks in a back and forth search pattern. As each block is found,
 the block will be moved to a staging area for further processing. After scanning the entire
ty of the area, the robot will identify each block in the staging area, then move the blocks
 to the desired order.
